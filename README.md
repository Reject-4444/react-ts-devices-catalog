**Project Description:**

React-devices-catalog is an interactive online store built using popular web technologies such as React, TypeScript, SASS, classnames, and react-router-dom. The platform showcases a collection of electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and accessories, allowing users to browse and add items to their favorites and shopping cart. The use of local storage ensures that selected items persist even after refreshing the page.

By integrating TypeScript, the development process is made more reliable and efficient, minimizing potential errors and improving the user experience. SASS is utilized to maintain well-organized CSS code, contributing to an attractive and user-friendly interface. The classnames library enables the application to adapt to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a responsive layout.

Additionally, the inclusion of react-router-dom enables seamless navigation, allowing users to explore different product categories, add items to favorites and the cart, and enjoy a smooth and engaging browsing experience.

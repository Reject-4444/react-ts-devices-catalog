**Project Description:**

**react-devices-catalog** is a dynamic web application built using React, TypeScript, SASS, classnames, and react-router-dom. It serves as a comprehensive catalog for various electronic devices, showcasing their specifications and features in an organized manner. Leveraging the power of React, the application provides users with an intuitive and interactive interface to explore and compare different devices seamlessly.

The integration of TypeScript ensures robust type-checking and facilitates a more reliable development process. SASS has been utilized to streamline the styling workflow, allowing for more maintainable and structured CSS code. The inclusion of the classnames library enables the dynamic assignment of classes, enhancing the application's flexibility and responsiveness.

Furthermore, the incorporation of react-router-dom enables smooth navigation and efficient routing within the application, offering users a seamless browsing experience across different device categories.

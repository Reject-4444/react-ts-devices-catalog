**Project Description:**

**react-devices-catalog** is an engaging internet storefront developed using React, TypeScript, SASS, classnames, and react-router-dom. The application serves as an immersive platform where users can explore a curated selection of electronic devices, including smartphones, tablets, and related accessories. It allows users to add items to their favorites and shopping cart, with all data cached in the local storage, ensuring the preservation of selected items even after page reloads.

The integration of TypeScript ensures a robust and efficient development process, minimizing potential errors and enhancing the overall user experience. Leveraging SASS, the project maintains well-structured and easily maintainable CSS code, contributing to an appealing and intuitive user interface. The dynamic class assignment facilitated by the classnames library ensures the application's responsiveness and adaptability across diverse screen sizes and devices.

Moreover, the inclusion of react-router-dom facilitates seamless navigation, enabling users to explore various product categories, add items to favorites and the cart, and experience a seamless and interactive browsing experience.
